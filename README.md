# 🎮 Infinity Leap

## 🚀 Project Description

**Infinity Leap** is a fun mobile game developed with Augmented Reality (AR) technology.  
A ball remains stationary on the screen and jumps every time you tap it, then falls down due to gravity.  
Your goal is to tap the ball as many times as possible without letting it hit the ground!  
The longer you keep it in the air, the more points you earn.  
**Have fun!**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React Native  
- JavaScript  
- Augmented Reality (AR) Libraries  
- Mobile Platform Support (Android & iOS)

---

## 💡 Features

- Real-time ball bounce mechanics  
- Scoring system  
- Restart option when the ball falls  
- Simple and fun user interface  
- AR-powered interaction with the real world

## 📱 How It Works

1. Launch the app.  
2. Tap the ball on the screen.  
3. The ball jumps with each tap.  
4. Tap again before it falls to keep it in the air.  
5. Each successful tap increases your score.  
6. If the ball hits the ground, the game ends and a restart option appears.
